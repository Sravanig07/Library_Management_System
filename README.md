# Library_Management_System

Our main objective in this project is to create a library management system using Binary Search Tree wherein students can issue books and the admin or librarian can update/delete the record of books kept in the library. The admin can add any new book in the already existing list of books. Similarly he can also delete any existing book. In the update option, the admin can update the quantity of books as well as the name of the book.
